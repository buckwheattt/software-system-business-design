## Project Idea  

TicketFactory is a proposal for a digital platform for online ticket sales and distribution. The goal is to replace manual and inefficient processes, enable customers to conveniently purchase tickets online with seat visualization, and at the same time reduce costs and streamline the work of branches.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two parts:

### 1. Business analysis – describes in detail the current problems, goals, roadmap, and estimates of costs and benefits.
